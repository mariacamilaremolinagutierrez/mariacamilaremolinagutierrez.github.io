I was part of the 2015 class of [LEAPS](http://leaps.strw.leidenuniv.nl/) (Leiden/ESA Astrophysics Program for Summer Students). It was a wonderful experience to do research among 21 young astrophysicists and all the observatory staff. The internship was held in the beautiful city of Leiden in The Netherlands. My advisor was [Dr. Lucie Jílková](http://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/people/touchscreen2/pers.php?id=1521) and we worked together with the computational astrophysics group lead by [Dr. Simon Portegies Zwart](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~spz/)

### Abstract

Free-Floating Planets (FFP) are planets that are not gravitationally bounded to any star and they 'float' around space. In this project I studied the possibility for a FFP to be captured by a solar system and become bounded to the collection of bodies. I used [AMUSE](http://amusecode.org) to simulate millions of incoming FFP and their interactions with the star-planet formation.
