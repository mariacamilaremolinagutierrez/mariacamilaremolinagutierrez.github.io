Free-Floating Planets (FFP) are planets that are not gravitationally bounded to any star and they 'float' around space. In this project I studied the possibility for a FFP to be captured by a solar system and become bounded to the collection of bodies. I used AMUSE (http://amusecode.org) to simulate millions of incoming FFP and their interactions with the star-planet formation.
