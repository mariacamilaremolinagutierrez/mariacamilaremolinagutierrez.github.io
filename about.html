## About

Hi! My name is Maria Camila. I am a 23 year old colombian. I am an Astrophysicist and a Systems &amp; Computing Engineer. Currently I am a master student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en" target="_blank">Universit√© Paris-Saclay</a> in Paris, France. I am very interested in astrophysical simulations, computational infrastructure and security. My favorite programming language (which was also my first) is Python, but I also really like C and Java.

In this website you will find out more about me, the projects I have worked on and the things I'm interested in. Here is a condensed version of my trajectory in pdf format:
