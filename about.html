## About

Hi! My name is Maria Camila. I am a 24 year old colombian. I am an Astrophysicist and a Systems &amp; Computing Engineer. Currently I am a master student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en" target="_blank">Universit√© Paris-Saclay</a> in Paris, France. I am very interested in the areas of: cryptography, high performance computing, human-computer interaction, data science and astrophysical simulations. My favorite programming language (which was also my first) is Python, but I also really like C and Java.

In this website you will find out more about me, the projects I have worked on and the things I'm interested in. Here is my Curriculum Vitae available to download in PDF format:
